* is the intensity spectrum for a gaussian pump in the sym gauge identical to the one of a delta pump in the landau gauge? NO
* are the real space state in the sym gauge identical to their counterparts in the landau gauge YES, but their phase is different

* sign of eta
** try larger lattice: 60x60
** check Fock-Darwin paper
** check contribution from perturbation theory



* exploratory
** landau gauge
*** explain minimum in gaussian
**** destructive interference
**** momentum space effect
**** phase of w.f.
