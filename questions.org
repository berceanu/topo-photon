* is the intensity spectrum for a gaussian pump in the sym gauge identical to the one of a delta pump in the landau gauge?
** are the 3 other spectra in the sym gauge identical to their landau counterparts
** if so, Fig. 4 can be omitted and explained in words
* are the real space state in the sym gauge identical to their counterparts in the landau gauge
** if so, top row of Fig. 5 can be omitted
* sign of eta
** try larger lattice: 60x60
** check Fock-Darwin paper
** check contribution from perturbation theory
* experimental figure
** pump on the upper edge
** try with alpha = 0.15
* exploratory
** symmetric gauge
*** try with large centered gaussian
** landau gauge
*** explain minimum in gaussian
**** destructive interference
**** momentum space effect
**** phase of w.f.
* more py resolution for analytics comparison
* draw gaussian pump profile on top of real-space w.f.
* what gives the intensity of the peaks in the spectrum?
** why for different pumps we get different orders of magnitude
