* results and discussion
** experimental proposal
*** Finite size effects.
*** Levels of second and first ladder show up as one.
*** We can compare the w.f. in the MBZ with its ananlytical expression.
*** The band is still flat at q=7 and the bandwidth is larger.
* conclusions
** higher level of analysis
** significance of the work
* approximations
** In the limit of small κ we need to consider the Fock Darwin state
** There are two main approximations in Hannah's paper.
** Their scaling of bandwidth and bandgap with q is different.
** The level spacing error is dominated by band-mixing effects. 
** We take the mean energy of the band as E₁.
** There is a positive contribution to the zero point energy error.
** For stronger traps, this contribution becomes negative.
